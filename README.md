# Automated Testing Framework for Game Hub

I've created a comprehensive automated testing framework for the **Game Hub** application. The Game Hub app is a modern React-based web application built with TypeScript and Vite that aggregates video game information via the Rawg.io API and delivers a responsive, visually appealing interface using Chakra UI.

## Testing Overview

For this testing project, I've developed a multi-layered test suite that covers:

- **Unit Testing**  
  Using Jest to validate the functionality of individual components and utility functions, ensuring that the smallest units of the code behave as expected.

- **API Testing**  
  Utilizing Playwright (or Postman) to test the API endpoints that fetch game data from Rawg.io. This ensures proper data retrieval, error handling, and response formatting.

- **UI Testing**  
  Employing Playwright or Selenium to verify that the user interface renders correctly across different browsers and devices, and that the components interact properly with each other.

- **End-to-End Testing**  
  Using Playwright to simulate real user workflows (e.g., searching for games and navigating through game details), confirming that all parts of the application integrate seamlessly.

## Project Significance

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement robust automated testing solutions and highlights my commitment to quality assurance in modern web applications. It is a critical part of my portfolio as I pursue QA Engineer roles, showcasing both my technical skills and my understanding of comprehensive test coverage.
